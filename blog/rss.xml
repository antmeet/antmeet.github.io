<p>
<p>
  Today, we are going to have our 100th meeting!
  Yes, <a href="../meets.html#100">the 100th meeting</a>! We began
  these book club meetings about five months ago. The first book we
  picked up for the club was <em>Introduction to Analytic Number
  Theory</em> (Apostol, 1976). We have been going through this book,
  page by page, in each meeting. We have a tiny but consistent
  community of 6 to 8 participants who meet regularly to study this
  book and share our understanding and insights with each other.
</p>
<p>
  In this blog post, I will talk about my personal experience in this
  book club and my personal journey about reading this book. It is
  worth keeping in mind then that what I am about to write below may
  not have any resemblance with the experience of other members of the
  book club. In fact, some members in the group are much smarter than
  I am, so I am pretty sure the experience of other members must be
  quite dissimilar to mine.
</p>

<h2 id="the-reading-experience">The Reading Experience<a href="#the-reading-experience"></a></h2>
<p>
  As far as I know, everyone who joins our meetings are involved in
  computer programming in one form or another. A few of them have very
  strong background in mathematics. I host the book club meetings
  everyday and read a couple of pages of the book aloud, show how to
  work through the proofs, explain some of the steps, etc. Sometimes I
  get stuck in some step that I find too unobvious. Sometimes the
  steps are obvious but my brain is too slow to understand why the
  steps work. But these tiny glitches have not been a problem so far,
  thanks to the extremely smart group of individuals who join these
  meetings on a daily basis and help explain why every step of the
  various proofs work.
</p>
<p>
  I believe the group members are the best part of these reading
  sessions. Thanks to the insights and explanation of the reading
  material shared by all these members, I am fairly confident that we
  are able to take a close look at every line of the book and convince
  ourselves that every step of the proofs work.
</p>
<p>
  Special thanks to Andrey for joining these meetings almost everyday
  and helping us all understand the material better by offering his
  insightful explanations, providing different and sometimes simpler
  ways of arriving at the same facts, etc. I believe anyone who has
  been part of these reading sessions would agree that Andrey has
  played a big role in our meetings with his insights and alternate
  approaches for solving the problems we have come across during the
  course of our study.
</p>

<h2 id="the-learning-experience">The Learning Experience<a href="#the-learning-experience"></a></h2>
<p>
  The first web meeting for the book club occurred on 5 Mar 2021. See
  the blog post <a href="hello-world.html">Hello, World!</a> to read
  about the early days of the book club and how it was formed. Back
  then, I knew little to nothing about analytic number theory.
  Although I was familiar with some of the elementary concepts like
  divisibility, Euler's totient function, modular arithmetic,
  calculus, and related theorems, chapter 2 of the book itself proved
  to be a significant challenge for me. In the second chapter, it
  became clear to me that we will be building new levels of
  mathematical abstractions on top of new levels of abstractions. The
  chapter began with a description of the M&ouml;bius function, a very
  neat and interesting function that I was previously unaware of. That
  was fun! But soon, this chapter began adding new layers of
  abstractions such as Dirichlet product, Dirichlet inverse,
  generalized convolution, etc. I could almost feel my brain
  stretching and growing as we went through each page of this chapter.
</p>
<p>
  I often saw that after I have learnt a new concept in a chapter, it
  would not become intuitive immediately. I would understand the
  concepts, understand the related theorems, understand each step of
  the proofs, solve exercise problems, know how to apply the theorems
  when needed, and yet I could not "feel" them. I wanted to not just
  understand the concepts but I also wanted to "feel" the concepts
  like the way I could feel algebra, calculus, computer programming,
  etc. In the initial days, I wondered if I was too old to develop
  good intuition for all these new and highly sophisticated concepts.
</p>
<p>
  Despite always feeling that all these concepts were too technical
  and quite unintuitive, I kept going. We kept hosting the book club
  meetings with a frequency of about 3-5 days every week. We read one
  section after another. We read one chapter after another. And then
  suddenly one day while reading chapter 4, something interesting
  happened. As we were employing Dirichlet products to obtain some
  useful results, I realized that the concept of <em>Dirichlet
  products</em> which once felt so foreign two chapters earlier, now
  felt completely intuitive. I could <em>see</em> different functions
  being equivalent to Dirichlet products intuitively and effortlessly.
  Dirichlet products felt no more alien than, say, arithmetic
  multiplication. I could "feel" it now. It was a great feeling. I
  realized that sometimes it might take a few additional chapters of
  reading and using those concepts over and over again before they
  really begin to feel intuitive.
</p>

<h2 id="three-concepts">Three Concepts<a href="#three-concepts"></a></h2>
<p>
  In this section, I will pick three interesting concepts from
  different parts of the book to provide a glimpse of what the journey
  has been a like. These three things occur in the book again and
  again and play a very important role in several chapters of the
  book. Of course, it goes without saying that there are many
  interesting concepts in the book and many of them may be more
  important than the ones I am about to show below.
</p>

<h3 id="the-mobius-function">The M&ouml;bius Function<a href="#the-mobius-function"></a></h3>
<p>
 For any positive integer \( n \), the M&ouml;bius function \( \mu(n) \) is
 defined as follows: \[ \mu(1) = 1; \] If \( n > 1, \) write \( n =
 p_1^{a_1} \dots p_k^{a_k} \) (prime factorization). Then
 \begin{align*}
 \mu(n) & = (-1)^k \text{ if } a_1 = a_2 = \dots = a_k = 1, \\
 \mu(n) & = 0 \text{ otherwise}.
 \end{align*}
 If \( n \ge 1, \) we have
 \[
 \sum_{d \mid n} \mu(d) =
 \begin{cases}
 1 & \text{ if } n = 1, \\
 0 & \text{ if } n > 1.
 \end{cases}
 \]
</p>
<p>
  I was unfamiliar with this function prior to reading the book. It
  felt like a nice little cute function initially but as we went
  through more chapters, it soon became clear that this function plays
  a major role in analytic number theory.
</p>
<p>
  As a simple example, we will see soon in this post that the Euler's
  totient function can be expressed as a Dirichlet product of the
  M&ouml;bius function and the arithmetical function \( N(n) = n \).
</p>
<p>
  As a more sophisticated example, the Dirichlet series with
  coefficients as the M&ouml;bius function is the multiplicative
  inverse of the Riemann zeta function, i.e., if \( s = \sigma + it \)
  is a complex number with its real part \( \sigma > 1 \), we have \[
  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s} = \frac{1}{\zeta(s)}. \] This
  immediately shows that \( \zeta(s) \ne 0 \) for \( \sigma > 1 \).
</p>

<h3 id="dirichlet-product">Dirichlet Product<a href="#dirichlet-product"></a></h3>
<p>
  If \( f \) and \( g \) are two arithmetical functions, their
  Dirichlet product \( f * g \) is defined as:

  \[
  (f * g)(n) = \sum_{d \mid n} f(d) g\left( \frac{n}{d} \right).
  \]

  Dirichlet products appear to pop up magically at various places in
  number theory. Here is a simple example:

  \[
  \varphi(n) = \sum_{d \mid n} \mu(d) \frac{n}{d}.
  \]

  Therefore in the notation of Dirichlet products, the above equation
  can also be written as

  \[
  \varphi = \mu * N
  \]

  where \( N \) represents the arithmetical function \( N(n) = n \)
  for all \( n \).
</p>

<h3 id="hurwitz-zeta-function">Hurwitz Zeta Function<a href="#hurwitz-zeta-function"></a></h3>
<p>
  For complex numbers \( s = \sigma + it \), the Hurwitz zeta function
  \( \zeta(s, a) \) is initially defined for \( \sigma > 1 \) as

  \[
  \zeta(s, a) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(n + a)^s}
  \] where \( a \) is a fixed real number, \( 0 < a < 1 \).

  Then by analytic continuation, it is defined for \( \sigma \le 1 \) as

  \[
  \zeta(s, a) = \Gamma(1 - s)I(s, a)
  \]

  where \( \Gamma \) represents the gamma function

  \[
  \Gamma(s) =  \int_0^{\infty} x^{s - 1} e^{-x} \, dx
  \]

  defined for \( \sigma > 0 \) and also defined, by analytic
  continuation, for \( \sigma \le 0 \) except for \( \sigma = 0, -1,
  -2, \dots \) (the nonpositive integers and \( I(s, a) \) is defined
  by the contour integral

  \[
    I(s, a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_C \frac{z^{s-1} e^{az}}{1 - e^z} \, dz
  \]

  where \( 0 < a \le 1 \) and the contour \( C \) is a loop around the
  negative real axis composed of three parts \( C_1 \), \( C_2 \), and
  \( C_3 \) such that for \( c < 2\pi \), we have \( z = re^{-\pi i}
  \) on \( C_1 \) and \( z = re^{\pi i} \) on \( C_3 \) as \( r \)
  varies from \( c \) to \( +\infty \), and \( z = ce^{i \theta} \) on
  \( C_2 \), \( -\pi \le \theta \le \pi \).
</p>
<p>
  Now admittedly, the definition or the analytic continuation of
  Hurwitz zeta function may seem very heavy and obscure to the
  uninitiated and it <em>is</em> indeed quite heavy. It takes 6 pages
  in chapter 12 to build the prerequisite concepts before we arrive at
  this definition. It is evident that this definition uses other
  concepts like the gamma function, a specific contour integral, etc.
  and it is only natural to expect that one has to gain sufficient
  expertise with the gamma function and contour integrals before the
  Hurwitz zeta function begins to feel intuitive.
</p>
<p>
  But once we have established the analytic continuation of the
  Hurwitz zeta function, many insightful facts about the Riemann zeta
  function follow readily. It is easy to see that the Riemann zeta
  function can be defined in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function as

  \[
  \zeta(s) = \zeta(s, 1) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}.
  \]

  Yes, the \( \zeta \) symbol is overloaded: \( \zeta(s, a) \) is the
  Hurwitz zeta function whereas \( \zeta(s) \) is the Riemann zeta
  function. This relationship between the Riemann zeta function and
  the Hurwitz zeta function along with the analytic continuation of
  the Hurwitz zeta function opens new doors into the wonderful world
  of complex numbers and let us obtain beautiful and profound facts
  about the Riemann zeta function such as the fact that it has zeros
  at negative even integers, i.e., \( \zeta(n) = 0 \) for \( n = -2,
  -4, -6, \dots \) and the fact that \( \zeta(0) = -\frac{1}{2} \) and
  \( \zeta(-1) = -\frac{1}{12} \) and so on.
</p>
<p>
  I believe beautiful results like these obtained by digging deep into
  complex analysis are what makes the study of analytic number theory
  so rewarding.
</p>

<h2 id="the-next-meeting">The Next Meeting<a href="#the-next-meeting"></a></h2>
<p>
  The next meeting is coming up today in a few hours. Are we planning
  anything special for the 100th meeting?
</p>
<p>
  I think the 100th meeting is a significant milestone in our journey
  of understanding the beautiful and interesting gems hidden away in
  the subject of analytic number theory. This milestone has been
  possible only due to the sustained curiousity and eagerness among
  the members of the group to learn a significant area of mathematics
  and learn it well. We have reached this milestone successfully due
  to the passion and love for mathematics that drive the regular
  members to join these meetings and go through a few pages of the
  book everyday. In these meetings, we have read 12 chapters
  consisting of over 250 pages so far. Many of us knew nothing about
  analytic number theory merely five months ago and now we can
  appreciate the Riemann zeta function at a deeper level. We now
  understand what the Riemann hypothesis really means. This has been
  a great journey so far.
</p>
<p>
  Despite being a significant milestone and cause for celebration, we
  are going to keep our 100th meeting fairly simple. We will continue
  where we left off yesterday. Today we have some more relationships
  between the gamma function and the Riemann zeta function to go
  through, so that is what we will do. We will also show that \(
  \zeta(0) = -\frac{1}{2} \) and \( \zeta(-1) = -\frac{1}{12} \) using
  the analytic continuation of the Hurwitz zeta function today.

<p>
  Welcome to the <a href="../">Offbeat Computation Club</a>!
</p>
<p>
  We are a mathematics and computation book club that began in the
  world of IRC networks. We plan to pick classics from the field
  of mathematics and computation, and read them together. The
  books and literature we pick for reading are of slightly offbeat
  nature, hence the name of this club! Our focus is on picking
  reading material about concepts and technologies that have been
  around for a long time and have an air of timelessness around
  them.
</p>
<p>
  In particular, we will not be chasing the latest trends in
  technology most of the time. But we are not a retrocomputing
  club either. For example, we are likely not going to talk about
  BASIC programming on Commodore 64. The topics we pick for our
  club meetings are largely going to be topics that are still
  quite relevant and important in the field of mathematics and
  computation but they may not be what is considered to be
  mainstream. For example, we will read books
  like <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> or talk
  about Common Lisp programming. Sometimes these topics may
  intersect with modern trends or retrocomputing but most of the
  times they would not. That is the kind of sweet spot we want to
  hit.
</p>

<h2 id="past">Past<a href="#past"></a></h2>
<p>
  Here is a little bit of history about our community. This
  community was born on the Freenode IRC network when I announced
  on the <code>##algorithms</code> and <code>##math</code>
  channels there that I would be hosting book club meetings on
  analytic number theory. I created a makeshift channel named
  <code>#susam</code> to discuss the book club activities and plan
  the meeting schedule. Several members joined this channel and
  the book club was formed.
</p>
<p>
  Our first meeting occurred via IRC on 4 Mar 2021. We realized
  that it would be much more efficient to discuss mathematics via
  audio along with a shared desktop session where we can use some
  software tool to scribble out and render mathematics formulas
  using LaTeX. So on the next day, that is, on 5 Mar 2021, we had
  our first web meeting via Zoom. Later,
  after <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26366464">an
  announcement on Hacker News</a>, some members from the Hacker
  News community joined our club too and the community grew a
  little bit more as a result.
</p>
<p>
  During the web meetings in the initial days of this club, I
  hacked up a tiny non-WSYIWYG tool that helped in typing out
  LaTeX code quickly and have it rendered on a pane using MathJax.
  This helped us to scribble mathematics quickly while
  understanding the concepts we came across in the book. This tool
  continued to evolve with our book club and it was soon released
  as <a href="https://muboard.net/">Muboard</a>. We use it often
  during our meetings.
</p>

<h2 id="present">Present<a href="#present"></a></h2>
<p>
  We moved to Libera IRC later and continued to operate out of a
  makeshift channel. It has now been more than 3 months since we
  began these meetings. Although our community is tiny, the
  meetings have been going on consistently and we have learnt
  numerous new and interesting concepts and theorems in the field
  of analytic number theory. After 3 months of successful
  meetings, today, that is, on 15 Jun 2021, I decided to create a
  more permanent place for our community with a name that
  represents our community better. This new community is now
  called the <em>Offbeat Computation Club</em>. I believe this new
  name represents the nature of our community and our meetings.
</p>
<p>
  In this community, we pick classics from the field of
  mathematics and computation and read them together. We are now
  operating out of
  the <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#offbeat">#offbeat</a>
  channel on Libera IRC.
</p>

<h2 id="future">Future<a href="#future"></a></h2>
<p>
  Since this club began, we have made good progress with the study
  of analytic number theory. The meetings for this topic have been
  going on consistencly. I have a little more free time now, so I
  can add a few more parallel meetings on other topics. Emacs and
  Lisp are on the top of my mind. I will plan something out and
  post an update soon. In the meantime, if any community member is
  interested to host their own book club meetings, we will have
  them added too to our schedule.
</p>

<h2 id="join-us">Join Us<a href="#join-us"></a></h2>
<p>
  Join our
  channel <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#offbeat">#offbeat</a>
  on Libera Chat and be a part of our club activities.
  Alternatively, you can also join our channel via its Matrix
  bridge
  at <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#offbeat:libera.chat">#offbeat:libera.chat</a>.
  Both the channel link and the bridge link point to the same
  channel, so you need to join only one of them, not both. If you
  are not an active IRC user, prefer joining the Matrix bridge
  because it is more convenient for someone unfamiliar with IRC.
  See you there!
