<p>
  Welcome to the Offbeat Computation Club! We are a mathematics
  and computation book club. We pick classics from the field of
  mathematics and computation and read them together.

  To join this club, use one of the links below to log into our
  IRC channel. All meeting schedule updates are announced here.

  You only need to join one of these links, not both. Both point
  to the same channel. If you are not an active IRC user, prefer
  joining the Matrix bridge because it is more convenient for
  someone unfamiliar with IRC. For example, you can close your
  browser or client and your chat session will still stay alive on
  the Matrix bridge. You can connect back the next day and catch
  up with the messages. Doing that with IRC requires slightly more
  work such as setting up IRC bouncers etc.

<p>
  The primary reference book for these meetings is
  <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> written by Tom
  M. Apostol. Admittedly, the book is quite expensive but you may
  find a relatively cheap paperback (softcover) copy on some
  websites.
</p>
<p>
  These meetings are hosted
  by <a href="https://github.com/susam">Susam</a> from
  the <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#algorithms">#algorithms</a>
  channel of Libera (earlier Freenode). These meetings are
  attended by some members of this channel, other related
  channels, as well as by some members
  from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.
</p>
<p>
  You are welcome to join our meetings anytime. If you are
  concerned that the meetings may not make sense if you join when
  we are in the middle of a chapter, please free to talk to us
  about it in <a href="#join">our channel</a>. We can recommend
  the next best time to begin joining our meetings. Usually, it
  would be when we begin reading a new section or chapter that is
  fairly self-contained and does not depend a lot on material we
  have read previously.
